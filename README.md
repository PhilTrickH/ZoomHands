We had an issue our local Kingdom Hall were the Brother on the platform couldn't see clearly when hands were raised on Zoom
This macro checks if any hands are raised and puts a overlay GUI up on the screen to prompt the Brother. It shows the number of hands raised and how long they have been raised for.
The windows tablet is set to 175% scaling. If you use different scaling then the hand symbols (all 5 colours) will need resampling, and also the (Me) so it knows the list is at the top.
